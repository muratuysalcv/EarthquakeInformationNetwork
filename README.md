It is a social network project that will serve as a bridge between earthquake experts and people living in houses at risk of earthquake. Citizens living in risky houses can submit information about their house, such as its location, visuals of cracks, and the age of the building, from the system.

It sends notifications to civil engineers, geological engineers and people with similar expertise who are experts in earthquakes.

Experts respond to requests by entering the admin panel. In this way, people living in high-risk buildings will be made aware.

The project consists of API, Admin and Presentation applications.
